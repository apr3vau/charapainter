Welcome to Charapainter. This is a program for creating art using characters.

We support both mouse and keyboard interaction. The keymap conforms with Emacs,
use C-f/b/p/n or arrow keys to move the cursor, ^Space to start a stroke or a
selection. Return / Escape / Backspace are works, too. Other keys will plainly
insert themselves.

After typing a character, the cursor will move right or down, based on your
choice via the toolbar. Use '⌘ -' and '⌘ \' to quickly swich between them.

We also support infinite drawing board size. Use ⌘+arrow keys, or the 'Pan' tool
to move the drawing board.

At the right side there's a color panel. Left click on the panel to set
foreground color, while right click to set background color.

Typing in the 'Current' on the left of the toolbar, or clicking the character at
the 'Characters' board, to set the default inserting character while you drag
mouse / press Return.

The Stroke tool can draw continuous line using the charset you choose.  Use
Shift+arrow key to adjust joint direction, or Ctrl+Shift+arrow key to add an
arrow mark.

If you find any bug, anything annoying, or want any features, feel free to
contact the developer by clicking Help -> Contact developer. The feedback can be
annonymous.

Create a new project (⌘N) to dismiss this motd and start drawing.
